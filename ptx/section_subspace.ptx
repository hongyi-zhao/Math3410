  <title>Subspaces</title>
  <p>
    We begin with a motivating example. Let <m>\vv</m> be a nonzero vector in some vector space <m>V</m>.
    Consider the set <m>S = \{c\vv\,|\, c\in \R\}</m>.
    Given <m>a\vv,b\vv\in S</m>, notice that <m>a\vv+b\vv=(a+b)\vv</m> is also an element of <m>S</m>,
    since <m>a+b</m> is again a real number.
    Moreover, for any real number <m>c</m>, <m>c(a\vv)=(ca)\vv</m> is an element of <m>S</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two important observations: one is that performing addition or scalar multiplication on elements of <m>S</m>
    produces a new element of <m>S</m>. The other is that this addition and multiplication is essentially that of <m>\R</m>.
    The vector <m>\vv</m> is just a placeholder. Addition simply involves the real number addition <m>a+b</m>.
    Scalar multiplication becomes the real number multiplication <m>ca</m>.
    So we expect that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication in <m>S</m> follow those in <m>\R</m>,
    so that <m>S</m> is like a <q>copy</q> of <m>\R</m> inside of <m>V</m>.
    In particular, addition and scalar multiplication in <m>S</m> will satisfy all the vector space axioms,
    so that <m>S</m> deserves to be considered a vector space in its own right.
  </p>

  <p>
    A similar thing happens if we consider a set <m>U=\{a\vv+b\ww\,|\, a,b\in\R\}</m>,
    where <m>\vv,\ww</m> are two vectors in a vector space <m>V</m>.
    Given two elements <m>a_1\vv+a_2\ww,b_1\uu+b_2\ww</m>, we have
    <me>
      (a_1\vv+a_2\ww)+(b_1\vv+b_2\ww) = (a_1+b_1)\vv+(a_2+b_2)\ww
    </me>,
    which is again an element of <m>U</m>, and the addition rule looks an awful lot like the addition rule
    <m>(a_1,a_2)+(b_1,b_2)=(a_1+b_1,a_2+b_2)</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
    Scalar multiplication follows a similar pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    In general we are often interested in subsets of vectors spaces that behave like <q>copies</q>
    of smaller vector spaces contained within the larger space.
    The technical term for this is <em>subspace</em>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-subspace">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a vector space, and let <m>U\subseteq V</m> be a subset.
        We say that <m>U</m> is a <term>subspace</term> of <m>V</m> if <m>U</m>
        is itself a vector space when using the addition and scalar multiplication of <m>V</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    If we were to follow the definition, then verifying that a subset <m>U</m> is a subspace would involve checking all ten vector space axioms.
    Fortunately, this is not necessary. Since the operations are those of the vector space <m>V</m>,
    most properties follow automatically, being inherited from those of <m>V</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-subspace-test">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a vector space and let <m>U\subseteq V</m> be a subset.
        Then <m>U</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\zer\in U</m>, where <m>\zer</m> is the zero vector of <m>V</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>U</m> is closed under addition. That is, for all <m>\uu_1,\uu_2\in U</m>, we have <m>\uu_1+\uu_2\in U</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>U</m> is closed under scalar multiplication. That is, for all <m>\uu\in U</m> and <m>c\in\R</m>, <m>c\uu\in U</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>U</m> is a vector space, then clearly the second and third conditions must hold.
        Since a vector space musy be nonempty, there is some <m>\uu\in U</m>,
        from which it follows that <m>\zer=0\uu\in U</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if all three conditions hold, we have axioms A1, A4, and S1 by assumption.
        Axioms A2 and A3 hold since any vector in <m>U</m> is also a vector in <m>V</m>;
        the same reasoning shows that axioms S2, S3, S4, and S5 hold.
        Finally, axiom A5 holds because condition 3 ensures that <m>(-1)\uu\in U</m> for any <m>\uu\in U</m>,
        and we know that <m>(-1)\uu=-\uu</m> by <xref ref="ex-more-props">Exercise</xref>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  </theorem>

  <p>
    In some texts, the condition that <m>\zer\in U</m> is replaced by the requirement that <m>U</m> be nonempty.
    Existence of <m>\zer</m> then follows from the fact that <m>0\vv=\zer</m>.
    However, it is usually easy to check that a set contains the zero vector,
    so it's the first thing one typically looks for when confirming that a subset is nonempty.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any vector space <m>V</m>, the set <m>\{\zer\}</m> is a subspace,
        known as the <em>trivial subspace</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>V=\mathbf{P}</m> is the vector space of all polynomials,
        then for any natural number <m>n</m>, the subset <m>U</m> of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>
        is a subspace of <m>V</m>. Another common type of polynomial subspace is the set of all polynomials with a given root.
        For example, the set <m>U=\{p(x)\in\mathbf{P}\,|\,p(1)=0\}</m> is easily confirmed to be a subspace.
        However, a condition such as <m>p(1)=2</m> would <em>not</em> define a subspace,
        since this condition is not satisfied by the zero polynomial.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <m>\R^n</m>, we can define a subspace using one or more homogeneous linear equations.
        For example, the set
        <me>
          \{(x,y,z)\,|\, 2x-3y+4z=0\}
        </me>
        is a subspace of <m>\R^3</m>. A non-homogeneous equation won't work, however, since it would exclude the zero vector.
        Of course, we should expect that any non-linear equation fails to define a subspace,
        although one is still expected to verify this by confirming the failure of one of the axioms.
        For example, the set <m>S=\{(x,y)\,|\,x=y^2\}</m> is not a subspace;
        although it contains the zero vector (since <m>0^2=0</m>), we have <m>(1,1)\in S</m>,
        but <m>2(1,1)=(2,2)</m> does not belong to <m>S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    In the next section, we'll encounter perhaps the most fruitful source of subspaces: sets of linear combinations (or <em>spans</em>).
