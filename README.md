# Math3410
Lecture notes for Math 3410 Linear Algebra at the University of Lethbridge, written in PreTeXt.

Originally this was planned as a means of producing Jupyter notebooks for in-class exercises,
but it morphed into a full-on textbook project.
The original computational motivation remains present, however:
throughout the book, interactive Sage cells are included with built-in Python (SymPy) code.
This lets students experiment with computational aspects of linear algebra without having to do tedious computations by hand.

The main 'class' branch contains the code for the textbook.
The master branch is not updated regularly. It contains PreTeXt code for a Math 3410 course syllabus.

## Contributing
If you find these notes useful (perhaps because you're a member of the Math & CS faculty at U of L assigned to teach Math 3410)
but you would like to make changes (adding exercises, perhaps)
the easiest way to do so is to (a) fork this repository, (b) work on a new branch, and (c) send me a pull request.
