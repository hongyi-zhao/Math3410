          <introduction>
            <p>
              Welcome to Math 3410 Linear Algebra, our most popular mathematics course at the 3000-level!
              Math 3410 is a second course in linear algebra.
              We will assume familiarity with basic computational procedures,
              like Gaussian elimination, matrix multiplication, <etc/>.
              We will take a dual-track approach in Math 3410,
              focusing on both theory and application.
              Theoretical content will demand some ability to write proofs.
              Applications will likely involve software and a small amount of coding.
            </p>

              Over the summer, the University of Lethbridge adopted an official recognition of our location on traditional Blackfoot territory.
              This acknowledgement also serves as a welcome message, and I am pleased to be able to include it here:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Oki, and welcome to the University of Lethbridge.
                Our University’s Blackfoot name is Iniskim, meaning Sacred Buffalo Stone.
                The University of Lethbridge acknowledges and deeply appreciates the Siksikaitsitapii peoples’ connection to their traditional territory.
                We, as people living and benefiting from Blackfoot Confederacy traditional territory,
                honour the traditions of people who have cared for this land since time immemorial.
                We recognize the diverse population of Aboriginal peoples who attend the University of Lethbridge and the
                contributions these Aboriginal peoples have made in shaping and strengthening the University community in the
                past, present, and in the future.

                    Nicholson's book is one of several good open texts on linear algebra.
                    I'll provide links to several others on Moodle.
                    You are free to use any book you want;
                    Nicholson's happens to cover the required content for Math 3410 better than others,
                    so I'll be referring to it for scheduling purposes.

                    Most weeks I can probably set aside an hour Wednesday afternoon,

            <subsubsection>
              <title>Can I get a print copy of the textbook?</title>
              <p>
                The <init>PDF</init> is available on Moodle, and the open license for the book allows you to print it.
                I didn't set anything up for Print on Demand with the bookstore
                (partly because I didn't settle on a book soon enough).
                If you want to be able to order a print copy through the bookstore,
                let me know and I'll try to arrange something.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What does a typical lecture look like?</title>

              <p>
                Generally we'll try to avoid a full 75 minutes of lecture,
                and leave time for hands-on work.
                (Trying proofs yourself is a lot more effective than watching me do them.)
                This means that you should <em>not</em> expect to see every bit of course content presented in detail during class.
                Do your best to come prepared.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some classes we'll be covering material that can be computationally demanding.
                Rather than make you do it all by hand, I'll make software available.
                I'll let you know on Moodle which days will involve computer work.
                Bring a laptop if you can; if not, people can work together.
                Any computer capable of running a modern (non-mobile) web browser will do.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>


            <subsubsection>
              <title>How do I find you if I need help with something?</title>
                <p>
                  My office is C540, in University Hall.
                </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>Do I need to make an appointment for office hours?
                What if I have class at that time?</title>
              <p>
                You don't need an appointment -- just drop in.
                <term>Office hours</term> are the times that I promise
                to be available for consultation.
                If the times I choose don't work, you can email me for an appointment.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What if my question is not related to the course?</title>
              <p>
                Come see me anyway, or send an email.
                If I can't help you myself, I'll try to direct you to someone who can.
                There's also some

              <title>OK, but what if it's kind of personal?</title>
              <p>
                If it affects your ability to participate in the course
                (or even if it doesn't), you can come talk to me.
                In many cases, you might be best off seeing Academic Advising or Counselling Services.
                Links to these services, and general advice, can be found on the

              <title>How do I make sure I do well in this course?</title>
              <p>
                That's a tricky question to answer in general, but here are some suggestions:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Work ahead. The sooner you try things, the sooner you'll know what you need help with.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Ask for help. Come to office hours whenever you can.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Learn the definitions (all of them).
                      But don't just memorize: make sure you understand what each one is saying.
                      Come up with examples (on your own) that relate to them.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Never, ever, say <q>I don't know where to begin!</q> on a problem, especially a proof.
                      Assume the hypothesis. Write out the definitions (which you've learned) of any technical terms.
                      You're probably already half-way there.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Don't read your textbook like it's a novel.
                      Reading math is a hands-on activity.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true?<ellipsis/>

              <title>Thanks, but what I really meant is, how do I earn my grade?</title>
              <p>
                Oh, right. The most frequently asked question of all.
                There are several different evaluation components that contribute to your grade:

              <title>What is involved with each of the graded components?</title>
              <p>
                Here are brief descriptions of each one:
                <dl>
                  <li>
                    <title>Quizzes</title>
                    <p>
                      We'll start each week with a short quiz (10 minutes or so).
                      Questions will be conceptual, or check your knowledge of definitions, <etc/>.
                      Significant computational work is unlikely.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <title>Assignments</title>
                    <p>
                      Take-home assignments will contain a mix of theory and application.
                      You will be asked to write proofs. You will also be asked to solve computational problems.
                      Computations can be done with the aid of a computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The preferred format for solutions to applied problems is the <term>Jupyter notebook</term>.
                      All U of L students have access to the <init>PIMS</init> Jupyter hub, called
                      <url href="https://uleth.syzygy.ca"><term>Syzygy</term></url>.
                      Jupyter notebooks will allow you to write both text and Python code.
                      I'll provide sample code to get you started.
                      You don't need to be a programmer. (I'm not.)
                      You just need to learn a few commands to perform things like matrix operations.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <title>Tests</title>
                    <p>
                      There will be two term tests. <alert>Test 1</alert> is scheduled for Thursday, October 10th.
                      <alert>Test 2</alert> is scheduled for Thursday, November 7th.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <em>Note:</em> Thursday, November 7th is just before the Fall Break.
                      This is preferable for me, since it gives me time to grade your second test.
                      But it's possible all your other instructors had the same idea.
                      If that's the case, we can hold Test 2 on Tuesday the 19th instead.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <title>Final Exam</title>
                    <p>
                      A traditional, cumulative, three-hour exam.
                      Note that final exams are no longer scheduled according to the timetable,
                      so the date of the final exam will not be known until sometime in October.
                      You should plan to remain on campus for the entire exam period.
                      The Registrar's Office <em>will not</em> allow you to reschedule due to travel conflicts.

                like varsity athletics, a conference, tea with the Queen, <etc/>, send me an email.
                We will try to arrange an alternate sitting of the test. (Individual stage only.)

                Contact me <init>ASAP</init> to make alternate arrangements.
                Make-up tests are possible, but only if you contact me in time.
                (Advance notice is preferred when possible.)
                If no arrangements can be made, we will meet to discuss adjustments to your grading scheme.

                No. This wastes health care resources and your time.
                Just email me to say you were sick.
                However, if you miss more than one test due to illness,
                we'll need to meet to discuss how to adjust your grade.

                Same thing, for this, or other circumstances beyond your control. Send me an email,
                and we'll sort something out. But if there's a snowstorm forecast for the night before,
                maybe don't plan a trip to Calgary.

              <p>
                First, make sure that you have registered with the University's
                <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre">Accommodated Learning Centre</url>.
                If you have exam accommodations, you'll need to schedule your exams with them.
                No need to let me know: they'll contact me to request a copy of your exam.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you require any in-class accommodations, or if there are any adjustments I can make
                to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
                All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn.

            <subsubsection>
              <title>Do we get to have calculators for the tests?</title>
              <p>
                Yes. Maybe even a computer, if I decide that I want to include computational problems,
                and I can guarantee that everyone has access to a computer.
                (You can safely assume that if a computer <em>is</em> allowed,
                someone will be watching you like a hawk to make sure you don't use it inappropriately.)

                Send me an email. Extensions are usually granted as long as they're granted ahead of time.
                Online homework extensions need to be in place before solutions become available.
                See me if you're having trouble, or take a look at the other resources mentioned in <xref ref="question-help">Question</xref>.

                If circumstances are conspiring to keep you from class on a regular basis, please meet with me
                to come up with a plan to get you through the course.

                Students are expected to abide by the policies and regulations as laid out in the
                <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/academic-calendar">Academic Calendar</url>.
                This includes the University's policies on plagiarism and academic misconduct.
                In Math 3410, this more or less amounts to not copying on the tests,
                and not getting someone else (including a website) to do your homework for you.

                      Any information I need to communicate to the class will be posted on Moodle,
                      or emailed to the class as an announcement via Moodle.

                      Email is not a good medium for discussing math.
                      Your best option is to ask me in person.
                      If that doesn't work, we have a class discussion forum,
