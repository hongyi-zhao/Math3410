<li><p>Suppose \(U\subseteq W\text{,}\) and let \(B=\{\vec{u}_1,\ldots, \vec{u}_k\}\) be a basis for \(U\text{.}\) Since \(B\) is a basis, it's independent. And since \(B\subseteq U\) and \(U\subseteq W\text{,}\) \(B\subseteq W\text{.}\) Thus, \(B\) is an independent subset of \(W\text{,}\) and since any basis of \(W\) spans \(W\text{,}\) we know that \(\dim U = k \leq \dim W\text{,}\) by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-steinitz.html" title="Theorem 2.4.1: Fundamental Theorem (Steinitz Exchange Lemma)">TheoremÂ 2.4.1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose \(U\subseteq W\) and \(\dim U = \dim W\text{.}\) Let \(B\) be a basis for \(U\text{.}\) As above, \(B\) is an independent subset of \(W\text{.}\) If \(W\neq U\text{,}\) then there is some \(\vec{w}\in W\) with \(\vec{w}\notin U\text{.}\) But \(U=\spn B\text{,}\) so that would mean that \(B\cup \{\vec{w}\}\) is a linearly independent set containing \(\dim U+1\) vectors. This is impossible, since \(\dim W=\dim U\text{,}\) so no independent set can contain more than \(\dim U\) vectors.</p></li>
