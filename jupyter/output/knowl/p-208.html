<p>An important result that comes out while trying to show that the “pivot columns” of a matrix (the ones that end up with leading ones in the RREF) are a basis for the column space is that the column rank (defined as the dimesion of \(\csp(A)\)) and the row rank (the dimension of the space spanned by the columns of \(A\)) are equal. One can therefore speak unabmiguously about the <dfn class="terminology">rank</dfn> of a matrix \(A\text{,}\) and it is just as it's defined in a first course in linear algebra: the number of leading ones in the RREF of \(A\text{.}\)</p>
