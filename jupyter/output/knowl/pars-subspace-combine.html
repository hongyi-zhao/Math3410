<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">New subspaces from old.</span></h5>
<p>On your first assignment, you showed that if \(U\) and \(W\) are subspaces of a vector space \(V\text{,}\) then the intersection \(U\cap W\) is also a subspace of \(V\text{.}\) You also showed that the union \(U\cup W\) is generally not a subspace, unless one subspace is contained in the other (in which case the union is just the larger of the two subspaces we already have).</p>
<p>In class, we discussed the fact that the right way to define a subspace containing both \(U\) and \(W\) is using their <dfn class="terminology">sum</dfn>: we define the sum \(U+W\) of two subspaces by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
U+W = \{\vec{u}+\vec{w} \,|\, \vec{u}\in U \text{ and } \vec{w}\in W\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We proved that \(U+W\) is again a subspace of \(V\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If \(U\cap W = \{\vec{0}\}\text{,}\) we say that the sum is a <dfn class="terminology">direct sum</dfn>, and write it as \(U\oplus W\text{.}\) The following theorem might help us understand why direct sums are singled out for special attention:</p>
<article class="theorem-like"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Theorem</span> <span class="codenumber">2.4.18</span>.</h6>
<p>Let \(U\) and \(W\) be subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space \(V\text{.}\) Then \(U+W\) is finite-dimensional, and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dim(U+W)=\dim U + \dim W - \dim(U\cap W)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div></article><p>If the sum is direct, then we have simply \(\dim(U\oplus W) = \dim U + \dim W\text{.}\) The other reason why direct sums are preferable, is that any \(\vec{v}\in U\oplus W\) can be written <em class="emphasis">uniquely</em> as \(\vec{v}=\vec{u}+\vec{w}\) where \(\vec{U}\in U\) and \(\vec{w}\in W\text{.}\)</p>
<article class="theorem-like"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Theorem</span> <span class="codenumber">2.4.19</span>.</h6>
<p>For any subspaces \(U,W\) of a vector space \(V\text{,}\) \(U\cap W = \{\vec{0}\}\) if and only if for every \(\vec{v}\in U+W\) there exist unique \(\vec{u}\in U, \vec{w}\in W\) such that \(\vec{v}=\vec{u}+\vec{w}\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="hiddenproof"><a data-knowl="./knowl/proof-5-hidden.html" title="Proof 2.4.19.1"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6></a></article><p>We end with one last application of the theory we've developed on the existence of a basis for a finite-dimensional vector space. As we continue on to later topics, we'll find that it is often useful to be able to decompose a vector space into a direct sum of subspaces. Using bases, we can show that this is always possible.</p>

<span class="type">Theorem</span> <span class="codenumber">2.4.20</span>.</h6>
<p>Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensonal vector space, and let \(U\) be any subspace of \(V\text{.}\) Then there exists a subspace \(W\subseteq V\) such that \(U\oplus W = V\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="hiddenproof"><a data-knowl="./knowl/proof-6-hidden.html" title="Proof 2.4.20.1"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof.</span></h6></a></article><p>The subspace \(W\) constructed in the theorem above is called a <dfn class="terminology">complement</dfn> of \(U\text{.}\) It is not unique; indeed, it depends on the choice of basis vectors. For example, if \(U\) is a one-dimensional subspace of \(\R^2\text{;}\) that is, a line, then any other non-parallel line through the origin provides a complement of \(U\text{.}\) Later we will see that an especially useful choice of complement is the <dfn class="terminology">orthogonal complement</dfn>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dimension.html#pars-subspace-combine">in-context</a></span>
