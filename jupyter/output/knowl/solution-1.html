<li><p>By definition, \(U_1 = \spn \{1+x,x+x^2\}\text{,}\) and these vectors are independent, since neither is a scalar multiple of the other. Since there are two vectors in this basis, \(\dim U_1 = 2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>If \(p(1)=0\text{,}\) then \(p(x)=(x-1)q(x)\) for some polynomial \(q\text{.}\) Since \(U_2\) is a subspace of \(P_2\text{,}\) the degree of \(q\) is at most 2. Therefore, \(q(x)=ax+b\) for some \(a,b\in\R\text{,}\) and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = (x-1)(ax+b) = a(x^2-x)+b(x-1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since \(p\) was arbitrary, this shows that \(U_2 = \spn\{x^2-x,x-1\}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The set \(\{x^2-x,x-1\}\) is also independent, since neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, this set is a basis, and \(\dim U_2=2\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If \(p(x)=p(-x)\text{,}\) then \(p(x)\) is an even polynomial, and therefore \(p(x)=a+bx^2\) for \(a,b\in\R\text{.}\) (If you didn't know this it's easily verified: if</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a+bx+cx^2 = a+b(-x)+c(-x)^2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>we can immediately cancel \(a\) from each side, and since \((-x)^2=x^2\text{,}\) we can cancel \(cx^2\) as well. This leaves \(bx=-bx\text{,}\) or \(2bx=0\text{,}\) which implies that \(b=0\text{.}\))</p>
<p>It follows that the set \(\{1,x^2\}\) spans \(U_3\text{,}\) and since this is a subset of the standard basis \(\{1,x,x^2\}\) of \(P_2\text{,}\) it must be independent, and is therefore a basis of \(U_3\text{,}\) letting us conclude that \(\dim U_3=2\text{.}\)</p>
