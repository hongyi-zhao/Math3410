    <introduction>
      <p>
        Linear algebra is a mature, rich subject, full of both fascinating theory and useful applications.
        One of the things you might have taken away from a first course in the subject is that there's a lot of tedious calculation involved.
        This is true, if you're a human. But the algorithms you learn in a course like Math 1410 are easily implemented on a computer.
        If we want to be able to discuss any of the interesting applications of linear algebra,
        we're going to need to learn how to do linear algebra on a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many good mathematical software products that can deal with linear algebra,
        like Maple, Mathematica, and MatLab. But all of these are proprietary, and expensive.
        Sage is a popular open source system for mathematics,
        and students considering further studies in mathematics would do well to learn Sage.
        Since most people in Math 3410 are probably not considering a career as a mathematician,
        we'll try to do everything in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is a very poplular programming language, partly because of its ease of use.
        Those of you enrolled in Education may find yourself teaching Python to your students one day.
        Also, if you do want to use Sage, you're in luck: Sage is an amalamation of many different software tools,
        including Python. So any Python code you encouter in this course can also be run on Sage.
      </p>

      <title>Jupyter</title>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to know about doing linear algebra in Python is how to access a Python environment.
        Fortunately, you do not need to install any software for this.
        The University of Lethbridge has access to the <term>Syzygy Jupyter Hub</term> service,
        provided by <init>PIMS</init> (the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences), Cybera, and Compute Canada.
        To access Syzygy, go to <url href="https://uleth.syzygy.ca">uleth.syzygy.ca</url>
        and log in with your ULeth credentials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: if you click the login button and nothing happens, click the back button and try again.
        Sometimes there's a problem with our single sign-on service.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary type of document you'll encounter on Syzygy is the <term>Jupyter notebook</term>.
        Content in a Juypter notebook is organized into <term>cells</term>.
        Some cells contain text, which can be in either <init>HTML</init> or <term>Markdown</term>.
        Markdown is a simple markup language. It's not as versatile as HTML, but it's easier to use.
        On Jupyter, markdown supports the LaTeX language for mathematical expressions.
        Use single dollar signs for inline math: <c>$\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)=\cos(x)$</c>
        produces <m>\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)=\cos(x)</m>, for example.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want <q>display math</q>, use double dollar signs.
        Unfortunately, entering matrices is a bit tedious.
        For example, <c>$$A = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp;\end{bmatrix}$$</c>
        produces
        <me>
          A = \begin{bmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\\4\amp 5\amp 6\end{bmatrix}
        </me>.
        Later we'll see how to enter things like matrices in Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also possible to use markdown to add <em>emphasis</em>, images, URLs, <etc />.
        For details, see the following <url href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheatsheet</url>,
        or this <url href="https://callysto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Callysto-Cheatsheet_12.19.18_web.pdf">quick reference</url>
        from <url href="https://callysto.ca/">callysto.ca</url>.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's cool about a Jupyter notebook is that in addition to markdown cells,
        which can present content and provide explanation,
        we can also include <em>code cells</em>. Jupyter supports many different programming languages,
        but we will stick mainly to Python.

      <title>Python basics</title>
      <p>
        OK, so you've logged into Syzygy and you're ready to write some code.
        What does basic code look like in Python?
        The good news is that you don't need to be a programmer to do linear algebra in Python.
        Python includes many different <em>libraries</em> that keep most of the code under the hood,
        so all you have to remember is what command you need to use to accomplish a task.
        That said, it won't hurt to learn a little bit of basic coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basic arithmetic operations are understood, and you can simply type them in.
        Hit <c>shift+enter</c> in a code cell to execute the code and see the result.
      </p>

      <sage>
        <input>
          3+4
        </input>
      </sage>

      <sage>
        <input>
          3*4
        </input>
      </sage>

      <sage>
        <input>
          3**4
        </input>
      </sage>

        <p>
          OK, great. But sometimes we want to do calculations with more than one step.
          For that, we can assign variables.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            a = 14
            b = -9
            c = a+b
            print(a, b, c)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Sometimes you might need input that's a string, rather than a number.
          We can do that, too.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            string_var = "Hey, look at my string!"
            print(string_var)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Another basic construction is a list.
          Getting the hang of lists is useful, because in a sense,
          matrices are just really fancy lists.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            empty_list = list()
            this_too = []
            list_of_zeros = [0]*7
            print(list_of_zeros)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Once you have an empty list, you might want to add something to it.
          This can be done with the <c>append</c> command.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            empty_list.append(3)
            print(empty_list)
            print(len(empty_list))
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Go back and re-run the above code cell two or three more times.
          What happens? Probably you can guess what the <c>len</c> command is for.
          Now let's get really carried away and do some <q>for real</q> coding, like loops!
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            for i in range(10):
                empty_list.append(i)
            print(empty_list)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Notice the indentation in the second line.
          This is how Python handles things like for loops, with indentation rather than bracketing.
          We could say more about lists but perhaps it's time to talk about matrices.

    <section xml:id="sec-sympy">
      <title>SymPy for linear algebra</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          <term>SymPy</term> is a Python library for symbolic algebra.
          On its own, it's not as powerful as programs like Maple,
          but it handles a lot of basic manipulations in a fairly simple fashion,
          and when we need more power, it can interface with other Python libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another advantage of SymPy is sophisticated <q>pretty-printing</q>.
          In fact, we can enable MathJax within SymPy,
          so that output is rendered in the same way as when LaTeX is entered in a markdown cell.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-sympy-basics">
        <title>SymPy basics</title>
        <p>
          Running the following Sage cell will load the SymPy library and turn on MathJax.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            from sympy import *
            init_printing()
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          <alert>Note:</alert> if you are going to be working with multiple libraries,
          and more than one of them defines a certain command,
          instead of <c>from sympy import all</c> you can do <c>import sympy as sy</c>.
          If you do this, each SymPy command will need to be appended with <c>sy</c>; for example,
          you might write <c>sy.Matrix</c> instead of simply <c>Matrix</c>.
          Let's use SymPy to create a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            A = Matrix(2,3,[1,2,3,4,5,6])
            A
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          The <c>A</c> on the second line asks Python to print the matrix using SymPy's printing support.
          If we use Python's <c>print</c> command, we get something different:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            print(A)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          We'll have more on matrices in <xref ref="subsec-sympy-matrix"/>.
          For now, let's look at some more basic constructions.
          One basic thing to be mindful of is the type of numbers we're working with.
          For example, if we enter <c>2/7</c> in a code cell,
          Python will interpret this as a floating point number (essentially, a division).
        </p>
        <p>
          (If you are using Sage cells in HTML rather than Jupyter, this will automatically be interpreted as a fraction.)
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            2/7
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          But we often do linear algebra over the rational numbers,
          and so SymPy will let you specify this:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational(2,7)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          You might not think to add the comma above, because you're used to writing fractions like <m>2/7</m>.
          Fortunately, the SymPy authors thought of that:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational(2/7)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Hmm... You might have got the output you expected in the cell above, but maybe not.
          If you got a much worse looking fraction, read on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another cool command is the <c>sympify</c> command, which can be called with the shortcut <c>S</c>.
          The input <c>2</c> is interpreted as an <c>int</c> by Python, but <c>S(2)</c> is a <q>SymPy <c>Integer</c></q>:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            S(2)/7
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Of course, sometimes you <em>do</em> want to use floating point, and you can specify this, too:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            2.5
          </input>
        </sage>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Float(2.5)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Float(2.5e10)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          One note of caution: <c>Float</c> is part of SymPy, and not the same as the core Python <c>float</c> command.
          You can also put decimals into the Rational command and get the corresponding fraction:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational(0.75)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          The only thing to beware of is that computers convert from decimal to binary and then back again,
          and sometimes weird things can happen:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational(0.2)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Of course, there are workarounds. One way is to enter <m>0.2</m> as a string:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational('0.2')
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Another is to limit the size of the denominator:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            Rational(0.2).limit_denominator(10**12)
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Try some other examples above. Some inputs to try are <c>1.23</c> and <c>23e-10</c>
        </p>

        <p>
          We can also deal with repeating decimals. These are entered as strings, with square brackets around the repeating part.
          Then we can <q>sympify</q>:
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            S('0.[1]')
          </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
          Finally, SymPy knows about mathematical constants like <m>e, \pi, i</m>,
          which you'll need from time to time in linear algebra.
          If you ever need <m>\infty</m>, this is entered as <c>oo</c>.
        </p>

        <sage>
          <input>
            I*I
          </input>
        </sage>
        <sage>
          <input>
            I-sqrt(-1)
          </input>
        </sage>
        <sage>
          <input>
            pi.is_irrational
          </input>
