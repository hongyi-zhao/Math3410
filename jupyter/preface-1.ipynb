One of the things you might have taken away from a first course in the subject is that there's a lot of tedious calculation involved. This is true, if you're a human. But the algorithms you learn in a course like Math 1410 are easily implemented on a computer. If we want to be able to discuss any of the interesting applications of linear algebra, we're going to need to learn how to do linear algebra on a computer.<\/p><\/div>"]},
{"cell_type":"markdown", "metadata":{}, "source":["<div class=\"mathbook-content\"><p xmlns:svg=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" id=\"p-2\">There are many good mathematical software products that can deal with linear algebra, like Maple, Mathematica, and MatLab. But all of these are proprietary, and expensive. Sage is a popular open source system for mathematics, and students considering further studies in mathematics would do well to learn Sage. Since most people in Math 3410 are probably not considering a career as a mathematician, we'll try to do everything in Python.<\/p><\/div>"]},
{"cell_type":"markdown", "metadata":{}, "source":["<div class=\"mathbook-content\"><p xmlns:svg=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" id=\"p-3\">Python is a very popular programming language, partly because of its ease of use. Those of you enrolled in Education may find yourself teaching Python to your students one day. Also, if you do want to use Sage, you're in luck: Sage is an amalgamation of many different software tools, including Python. So any Python code you encounter in this course can also be run on Sage. <em class=\"emphasis\">You do not have to be a programmer<\/em> to run the code in this book. We'll be primarily working with the <dfn class=\"terminology\">SymPy<\/dfn> Python library, which provides many easy to use functions for operations like determinant and inverse.<\/p><\/div>"]},
{"cell_type":"markdown", "metadata":{}, "source":["<div class=\"mathbook-content\"><p xmlns:svg=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" id=\"p-4\">These notes originally began as an attempt to make Python-based worksheets that could be exported from PreTeXt to Jupyter, for use in the classroom. It quickly became apparent that something more was needed, and the worksheets morphed into lecture notes. These are intended to serve as a textbook for Math 3410, but with some work they can also be used in class. The notes are written in PreTeXt, and can be converted to both Jupyter notebooks and reveal.js slides.<\/p><\/div>"]},
{"cell_type":"markdown", "metadata":{}, "source":["<div class=\"mathbook-content\"><p xmlns:svg=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" id=\"p-5\">I initially wrote these notes during the Fall 2019 semester, for Math 3410 at the University of Lethbridge. The original textbook for the course was <em class=\"emphasis\">Linear Algebra with Applications<\/em>, by Keith Nicholson. This book is available as an open education resource from <a class=\"external\" href=\"https:\/\/lyryx.com\/linear-algebra-applications\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lyryx Learning<\/a>. Since these notes followed our course, and the course, to some extent, followed Nicholson's book, the notation, terminology, and (to some extent) organization of content aligns with that in Nicholson. (However, in a few places a careful reader might be able to detect the influence of Sheldon Axler's beautiful <em class=\"emphasis\">Linear Algebra Done Right<\/em>.)<\/p><\/div>"]}
