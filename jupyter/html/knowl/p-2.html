<p>Linear algebra is a mature, rich subject, full of both fascinating theory and useful applications. One of the things you might have taken away from a first course in the subject is that there's a lot of tedious calculation involved. This is true, if you're a human. But the algorithms you learn in a course like Math 1410 are easily implemented on a computer. If we want to be able to discuss any of the interesting applications of linear algebra, we're going to need to learn how to do linear algebra on a computer.</p>
